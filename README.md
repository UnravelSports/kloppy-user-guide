## What is it?

Each vendor of soccer data uses its own unique format to describe the course of a game. Hence, software written to analyze this data has to be tailored to a specific vendor and cannot be used without modifications to analyze data from other vendors. Kloppy is a Python package that addresses the challenges posed by the variety of data formats and aims to be the fundamental building block for processing soccer tracking and event data. Kloppy standardizes two types of datasets, namely event data and tracking data. These datasets are generally constructed from two files: a file containing raw (event/tracking) data and a meta data file containing pitch dimensions, squad, match and player information etc.

The creation of these standardized datasets is called **"deserialization"**. 

‚òï **Kloppy** is powered by [PySport](https://pysport.org/)  (non-profit, RSIN: 866294211). Consider [contributing](#contributing-to-kloppy) or [donating](https://pysport.org/) to ensure its longevity!

## Main features
- [**Load and Standardize Event Data**]()
- [**Load and Standardize Tracking Data**]()
- [**Standardized Meta Data**]()
- [**Filtering**]()
- [**Transformation**]()

#### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Quick Start

There are multiple providers that offer public / free data. Loading this data is directly supported within kloppy. 

```python
from kloppy import sportec

# load
dataset = sportec.load_open_event_data(match_id="J03WMX")

# filter & transform
goals = (
  dataset
  .filter("shot.goal")
  .transform(
    to_coordinate_system="opta",  
    to_orientation="STATIC_HOME_AWAY"
  )
)

# export
goals.to_df(
  "player", 
  "coordinates_*", 
  assist=lambda event: event.prev("pass"),
  engine="polars"
)
```
